-- 06 · Cash concentration
-- =====================================================================================
-- Question : is cash fragmented across too many accounts - idle in some while others are overdrawn?
-- Metrics  : number of accounts holding cash; share of cash in the top accounts; idle balances above
--            target; overdrawn vs surplus positions that could offset; estimated benefit of pooling.
-- Chart    : balance vs target per account (bar with target marker); daily idle vs overdrawn (area).
-- So what  : an estimated S$ per year saved by pooling / sweeping - the number a treasurer acts on.
-- Tables   : fact_balance, dim_account (target_balance, overdraft_limit, credit_rate, debit_rate,
--            is_pooled, pool_header_account_id), fact_sweep
-- =====================================================================================


-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 1 · Latest balance per account vs its target
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--   * excess_over_target > 0: cash sitting above what the account needs (idle)
--   * negative closing_balance: overdrawn, paying debit interest
WITH latest AS (
    SELECT MAX(date_id) AS date_id FROM fact_balance
)
SELECT a.account_id,
       a.entity_id,
       a.currency_code,
       a.is_pooled,
       ROUND(b.closing_balance, 0)                    AS balance,
       a.target_balance,
       ROUND(b.closing_balance - a.target_balance, 0) AS excess_over_target,

JOIN latest l      ON l.date_id = b.date_id
JOIN dim_account a ON a.account_id = b.account_id
ORDER BY balance_sgd DESC;


-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Step 2 · Estimated benefit of pooling (per year)
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Daily cost of NOT pooling = overdraft interest paid + credit interest forgone:
--   overdrawn amount x debit_rate / 365   (debit_rate is annual, from dim_account)
-- Sum over a year of days. That's the headline number.
-- CNY and INR are restricted currencies (dim_currency.is_restricted): their idle cash cannot be
-- pooled with other countries, so it is left out of the saving (see the approach below).
--
-- Approach (unpooled accounts only, in-house bank excluded):
--   * idle_sgd / overdrawn_sgd per account per day, converted with fact_fx_rate
--   * only unrestricted idle cash is movable; CNY / INR idle cash stays trapped
--   * offsettable = MIN(movable idle, overdrawn), compared across the whole group per day
--   * rates are weighted by the amount they apply to: SUM(amount x rate) / SUM(amount)
--   * saving = offsettable x (weighted debit rate - weighted credit rate) / 365
--   * gross benefit: the data has no cost of running a pool

-- Step 3 · The same benefit under three treatments of the HQ in-house bank (E01)
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- E01 holds almost all of the overdraft, so whether it counts decides the headline number.
--   A: subsidiaries only (E01 excluded)
--   B: E01 included, all overdraft can be offset
--   C: E01 included, restricted-currency (CNY / INR) overdraft cannot be offset (lower bound)
-- annual_saving_sgd = total over all days / (days / 365), so a partial first year does not skew it.
