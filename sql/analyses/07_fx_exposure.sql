-- Question : which foreign currencies are we long or short, by how much, and how much is hedged?
-- Metrics  : net position by currency (receipts minus payments) in non-functional currencies;
--            value at risk from a 5% / 10% currency move; hedged vs unhedged share.
-- Chart    : waterfall or stacked bar by currency (long up, short down; hedged vs unhedged).
-- So what  : where a forward contract or netting would help.
-- Tables   : fact_payment, dim_account, dim_entity (functional_currency), fact_fx_rate, fact_fx_hedge
--
-- Key idea: a EUR payment is only FX EXPOSURE for an entity whose home (functional) currency is
-- NOT EUR. Germany GmbH paying in EUR has no exposure; SG Operations receiving EUR does.
