-- 03 · Payment efficiency
-- =====================================================================================
-- Question : how fast and how "hands-free" are our payments?
-- Metrics  : average processing time (initiated -> settled), share taking over 48 hours,
--            straight-through processing (STP) rate, share needing manual repair, share
--            that missed the cut-off; by channel and rail.
-- Chart    : STP rate by channel (bar); average hours by rail (bar); stage durations (stacked bar).
-- So what  : moving LEGACY_FILE users to API, or submitting before cut-off, saves hours per payment.
-- Tables   : fact_payment, dim_payment_type, fact_payment_event
-- =====================================================================================

--   * is_stp: 1 = no human touched it end to end
--   * repair_count: number of manual fixes (e.g. bad account number corrected by ops)
--   * missed_cutoff: submitted after the rail's daily cut-off, so it rolled to the next day
--   * channel: how we sent it (API, H2H_FILE, PORTAL, LEGACY_FILE). INBOUND = receipts, excluded.
--   * direction = 'OUT' only: we only control how payments we SEND are processed.
